*** Prevent package.el from enabling all packages before init

invoked in the init process prior to `require'ing any packages installed with
`package-install'.

**** Minimize garbage collection during startup

#+begin_quote
My advice is to spend some time measuring the effect of increased GC threshold
on operations that you care about and that take a long enough time to annoy,
and use the lowest threshold value which produces a tangible improvement.
Start with the default value, then enlarge it by a factor of 2 until you see
only insignificant speedups. I would not expect the value you arrive at to be
as high as 100 MiB.

**** DISABLED Simplify filename pattern-matching during init

- Note taken on [2024-03-23 Sat 03:24] \\
  Quick followup: I would not be surprised if this had something to do with adding
  ~ceamx-restore-file-name-handler-alist-h~ on ~ceamx-after-init-hook~, which is
  equivalent to ~elpaca-after-init-hook~.
- Note taken on [2024-03-23 Sat 03:01] \\
  This snippet appears to cause Emacs to lose track of its own source files in most sessions.

  ~describe-function~ and ~helpful-function~ report symbols "without a source
  file".  I did not have much to go on until I became aware of ~find-function~.
  After invoking the latter on a function whose source could not be located, I
  noticed a clue: ~find-function~ somehow knew about the source file with a =.el=
  extension.  I investigated the Emacs =lisp/= directory and saw that there are no
  =.el= files -- only =.elc= and =.el.gz=.  The =.elc= files are unreadable, but
  Emacs is still able to read the compressed =gz= archives.  I still do not know
  exactly why it forgot.

  The issue has not been consistent, which likely indicates a race condition.  For
  a while, I assumed the issue occurred in consecutive sessions after calling
  ~restart-emacs~, but that was not the case.

  Disabling this hack is the only consistent way I found to help Emacs find
  itself.  Re-enabling it caused the issue to recur.  In the end, after
  disabling, I see absolutely no difference in startup performance.
  Optimization-by-copypasta strikes again.

  This has been a very frustrating regression in many/most of my Emacs sessions.
  I rely a lot on being able to read Emacs Lisp source code to understand how
  Emacs works -- that is how I learn.  Without being able to view source, I am
  left only with a lack of clarity.

  "Evaluate BODY after PACKAGE have loaded.

PACKAGE is a symbol (or list of them) referring to Emacs
features (aka packages).  PACKAGE may use :or/:any and :and/:all
operators.  The precise format is:

- An unquoted package symbol (the name of a package)
    (after! package-a BODY...)
- An unquoted, nested list of compound package lists, using any combination of
  :or/:any and :and/:all
    (after! (:or package-a package-b ...)  BODY...)
    (after! (:and package-a package-b ...) BODY...)
    (after! (:and package-a (:or package-b package-c) ...) BODY...)
- An unquoted list of package symbols (i.e. BODY is evaluated once both magit
  and git-gutter have loaded)
    (after! (magit git-gutter) BODY...)
  If :or/:any/:and/:all are omitted, :and/:all are implied.

This emulates `eval-after-load' with a few key differences:

1. No-ops for package that are disabled by the user (via `package!') or not
   installed yet.
2. Supports compound package statements (see :or/:any and :and/:all above).

;;;; Use latest versions of some Emacs builtins to satisfy bleeding-edge packages

;; Installing the latest development versions of `eglot' and `magit' (for
;; example) comes with the significant caveat that their dependencies often
;; track the latest versions of builtin Emacs libraries. Those can be installed
;; via GNU ELPA.
;;
;; Since core libraries like `seq' are often dependencies of many other packages
;; or otherwise loaded immediately (like `eldoc'), installation and activation
;; of the newer versions needs to happen upfront to avoid version conflicts and
;; mismatches. For example, we do not want some package loaded earlier in init
;; to think it is using the builtin version of `seq', while a package loaded
;; later in init uses a differnt version. I am not sure how realistic such a
;; scenario might be, or whether it would truly pose a problem, but the point is
;; that we should aim for consistency.
;;
;; Oftentimes, these builtins must be unloaded before loading the newer version.
;; This applies especially to core libraries like `seq' or the
;; enabled-by-default `global-eldoc-mode' provided by `eldoc', but not
;; `jsonrpc', since its functionality is specific to more niche features like
;; inter-process communication in the case of `eglot'.
;;
;; A feature must only be unloaded once, *before* loading the version installed
;; by Elpaca. Normally, that is not an issue because the init file is only
;; loaded once on session startup. But when you are re-loading the init file
;; inside a running session, you'd actually end up unloading the version that
;; Elpaca loaded. To prevent that, the unloading should happen only once --
;; during session startup -- so we check for a non-nil value of `after-init-time'.
;;
;; I don't understand why the Elpaca-installed feature/package only seems to be
;; loaded during the initial session startup? Unless the unloading happens
;; conditionally based on `after-init-time' as described above, every time the
;; init file is reloaded and `elpaca-process-queues' runs in
;; `+auto-tangle-reload-init-h', I get a bunch of errors (not warnings!) about
;; `eglot' and `org' as missing dependencies.

;;; Commentary:

;; <karthink> has a helpful summary of `display-buffer' action functions and
;; alist entries in their Emacs configuration, which I am also including here
;; for my own reference. Note that this list is not necessarily complete.

;;;; display-buffer-action-functions are:
;;  `display-buffer-same-window' -- Use the selected window.
;;  `display-buffer-reuse-window' -- Use a window already showing the buffer.
;;  `display-buffer-reuse-mode-window' -- Use a window with the same major-mode.
;;  `display-buffer-in-previous-window' -- Use a window that did show the buffer before.
;;  `display-buffer-use-some-window' -- Use some existing window.
;;  `display-buffer-pop-up-window' -- Pop up a new window.
;;  `display-buffer-below-selected' -- Use or pop up a window below the selected one.
;;  `display-buffer-at-bottom' -- Use or pop up a window at the bottom of the selected frame.
;;  `display-buffer-pop-up-frame' -- Show the buffer on a new frame.
;;  `display-buffer-in-child-frame' -- Show the buffer in a child frame.
;;  `display-buffer-no-window' -- Do not display the buffer and have `display-buffer' return nil immediately.

;;;; Action alist entries are:
;;  `inhibit-same-window' -- A non-nil value prevents the same
;;     window from being used for display.
;;  `inhibit-switch-frame' -- A non-nil value prevents any frame
;;     used for showing the buffer from being raised or selected.
;;  `reusable-frames' -- The value specifies the set of frames to
;;     search for a window that already displays the buffer.
;;     Possible values are nil (the selected frame), t (any live
;;     frame), visible (any visible frame), 0 (any visible or
;;     iconified frame) or an existing live frame.
;;  `pop-up-frame-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of
;;     frame parameters to give a new frame, if one is created.
;;  `window-height' -- The value specifies the desired height of the
;;     window chosen and is either an integer (the total height of
;;     the window), a floating point number (the fraction of its
;;     total height with respect to the total height of the frame's
;;     root window) or a function to be called with one argument -
;;     the chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the
;;     height of the window; its return value is ignored.  Suitable
;;     functions are `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer' and
;;     `fit-window-to-buffer'.
;;  `window-width' -- The value specifies the desired width of the
;;     window chosen and is either an integer (the total width of
;;     the window), a floating point number (the fraction of its
;;     total width with respect to the width of the frame's root
;;     window) or a function to be called with one argument - the
;;     chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the width
;;     of the window; its return value is ignored.
;;  `preserve-size' -- The value should be either (t . nil) to
;;     preserve the width of the chosen window, (nil . t) to
;;     preserve its height or (t . t) to preserve its height and
;;     width in future changes of the window configuration.
;;  `window-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of window
;;     parameters to give the chosen window.
;;  `allow-no-window' -- A non-nil value means that `display-buffer'
;;     may not display the buffer and return nil immediately.

***** Requirements

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'lib-common)
(require 'lib-keys-meow)
#+end_src

***** Install and load Meow

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! meow)
#+end_src

****** Load meow after Which-Key to circumvent Meow-Keypad UI issues

Meow's leader functionality has a custom keybinding visualization helper that
looks almost exactly like =which-key= except that it is very buggy. It does try
to smooth over some of the guts of Meow, as =which-key= is cluttered with
keybinding entries for =meow-digit-argument=. But even Meow's maintainers do not
recommend using the custom keypad helper UI.

Unfortunately, AFAIK there is no way to disable the UI feature explicitly
without disabling the Keypad entirely. The only way to prevent this feature from
causing workflow issues is by installing =which-key= and letting Meow defer to
=which-key= for this kind of interface.

And so, we load Meow after Which-Key:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'which-key
  (require 'meow))
#+end_src

And allow Elpaca to finish processing its queues, since everything afterwards depends on Meow.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(keymap-unset meow-motion-state-keymap "SPC" t)
#+end_src

****** Determine the dispatch target for the leader keymap with =meow-keypad-leader-dispatch=

I will maintain sections on both options, tangling only one at a time.

I have not yet found a configuration with which I am completely comfortable -- I
tend to switch between the two. Part of the reason for that is that I have not
kept a record of my assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of the different
values I have tried. So, here I will do just that.

******* ACTIVE Leader keymap from =meow-keymap-alist= (default)

When =meow-keypad-leader-dispatch= is nil, the leader will dispatch to the
leader keymap in =meow-keymap-alist=.

This is the default behavior.

| Pros                                               | Cons                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| Filters out noise                                  | Requires additional keystroke =c= to get to =C-c= |
| With =c= press, Ctrl mod is primed (i.e. =C-c C-=) |                                                   |

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt meow-keypad-leader-dispatch nil)
#+end_src

******* Leader dispatch to =mode-specific-map= ("C-c")

| Pros                                | Cons                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Direct access, no need to press =c= | Noisy, especially in Org-Mode                                                    |
| Direct access to Org-Mode keys      | Next keypress is unmodded, e.g. in Org: =SPC t= is "C-c t"                       |
|                                     | *To access main Org bindings under =C-c C-<CHAR>=, you still need to press =c=!* |
|                                     |                                                                                  |

=C-c= might be better for leader-centric bindings a la Doom/Spacemacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setopt meow-keypad-leader-dispatch "C-c")
#+end_src

***** Customize the appearance of the mode-line indicator for the current Meow state

This should happen before defining any new states so that they may provide their
own values upon definition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt meow-replace-state-name-list
        '( (normal . "🅝")
           (beacon . "🅑")
           (insert . "🅘")
           (motion . "🅜")
           (keypad . "🅚")))
#+end_src

***** DISABLED Define a new state for navigating Org-Mode trees

Unfortunately, this is unusable. I lose access to "M-v" and even the "ESC"
binding doesn't work.

Perhaps a Transient menu is a better option.

;; This configuration file is intended to be loaded after every keybinding is in

;; keybindings.

;; For example, `which-key' does not seem to like the way that `meow' handles
;; keybindings -- see the documentation for
;; `meow-keypad-describe-keymap-function' -- displaying only
;; `which-key-prefix-prefix'. `general.el' behaves similarly, from what I can
;; recall. I suspect this has something to do with key translations, a subject
;; with which I am currently unfamiliar.

;; 2024-01-13 UPDATE: My previous note about `which-key' and `meow' interaction
;; makes me wonder if in fact the behavior I was describing was actually Meow's
;; broken `which-key'-like popups. Still, I have seen the described behavior
;; from both packages.

;; I would much rather have some slightly-more-manual method of compiling these
;; "cheatsheets" for specific maps in a hydra-like UI. But I don't want to
;; entirely sacrifice the usage of builtin keymap functionality for the

***** Load Embark after an idle delay

<2024-03-20 Wed> Embark weighs in at nearly 5k lines-of-code at the time of
writing, so loading it immediately would probably cause a noticeable lag in
session startup.

Embark, like any package with autoloaded commands, will not load until one of
its autoloads is invoked. That has a few consequences, since Embark is versatile
enough to be used as glue for some other, more niche packages.

The =repeat-help= package defaults to using Embark's key help facilities before
falling back to =which-key=. I'd like to try out the Embark UI, as it seems more
legible.

Another benefit to a deferred load is a faster initial display in response to
invoking a command. If the feature needs to be loaded in response to invoking an
autoloaded command e.g. =embark-act=, there will be a multi-second delay.

** Expandable Abbreviations & Templates

*** CANCELLED Rename the existing feature to =init-snippets=
CLOSED: [2024-03-24 Sun 14:44]


- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2024-03-24 Sun 14:44] \\
  "Templates" is a more correct term than "snippets".

  Templates may have placeholders to be filled and expanded.

  Snippets are static chunks of text, often "tricks" and easy-to-forget reference
  material.

  Templates may include a snippet in their expansion.  Snippets in themselves have
  no relation to templates, unless we are coincidentally talking about a snippet
  whose subject is templates.  I will say no more on that matter so that we may
  avoid further confusion.

*** Reference

**** TempEl Template Syntax

- Source :: [[https://github.com/minad/tempel/blob/main/README.org#template-syntax][tempel/README.org at main · minad/tempel · GitHub]]

All the Tempo syntax elements are fully supported. The syntax elements are described in detail in the docstring of =tempo-define-template=  in tempo.el. We document the important ones here:

- “string” Inserts a string literal.
- =p=  Inserts an unnamed placeholder field.
- =n=  Inserts a newline.
- =>= Indents with =indent-according-to-mode= .
- =r=  Inserts the current region. If no region is active, quits the containing template when jumped to.
- =r>= Acts like =r= , but indent region.
- =n>=  Inserts a newline and indents.
- =&=  Insert newline unless there is only whitespace between line start and point.
- =%=  Insert newline unless there is only whitespace between point and line end.
- =o= Like =%=  but leaves the point before newline.
- =(s NAME)=  Inserts a named field.
- =(p PROMPT <NAME> <NOINSERT>)= Insert an optionally named field with a prompt. The =PROMPT= is displayed directly in the buffer as default value. If =NOINSERT= is non-nil, no field is inserted. Then the minibuffer is used for prompting and the value is bound to =NAME= .
- =(r PROMPT <NAME> <NOINSERT>)= Insert region or act like =(p ...)= .
- =(r> PROMPT <NAME> <NOINSERT>)= Act like =(r ...)= , but indent region.

Furthermore Tempel supports syntax extensions:

- =(p FORM <NAME> <NOINSERT>)= Like =p= described above, but =FORM=  is evaluated.
- =(FORM ...)=  Other Lisp forms are evaluated. Named fields are lexically bound.
- =q=  Quits the containing template when jumped to.

;;; Commentary:

;;;; Requirements:

;; Emacs 29+ built with tree-sitter support.
;; If using Nix, this is handled by default, done.
;;
;; Linux: `pkgs.emacs29' or `emacs-overlay.packages.emacs-unstable-pgtk'
;; Darwin: `pkgs.emacs29-macport'

;; Add these to `programs.emacs.extraPackages':
;;
;;  - `epkgs.treesit-auto'
;;  - `epkgs.treesit-grammars.with-all-grammars'

;;;; Mode Association:

;; NOTE: This feature is intended to be loaded *after* all other language
;;       packages have been installed so that `treesit-auto' it can override `auto-mode-alist'.

;;  By default, Emacs plays it safe with tree-sitter language support so as not
;;  to override legacy mode file extension associations. This makes sense as a
;;  default, but it's a pain to have to override `auto-mode-alist' for every
;;  language individually.
;;
;;  `treesit-auto' is pretty smart about how it handles these behaviors; its
;;  readme provides more in-depth details.

;;  In short, `global-treesit-auto-mode' will:
;;
;;  - Automatically switch to <name>-ts-mode when the grammar for <name> is installed
;;  - Stick with <name>-mode if the grammar isn’t installed
;;  - Automatically install a grammar before opening a compatible file
;;  - Modify auto-mode-alist for tree-sitter modes

;;  See also <https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d/blob/master/lisp/init-treesitter.el>
;;  for a more manual approach.

;;; Code:

(require 'treesit)

(require 'lib-common)

;;; Automatically use available `treesit' modes via `treesit-auto'

;; <https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto>

;; NOTE: This package does *not* automatically manage mode-hook translation.
;; Those should be managed manually on a case-by-case basis. For example,
;; `nix-ts-mode-hook' does not currently inherit the value of `nix-mode-hook'.
;; Some Tree-Sitter modes, however, still derive from their non-Tree-Sitter
;; predecessor, and so will also run that mode's hooks in addition to its own.

(package! treesit-auto

  "Display a debug warning showing the runtime value of ARGS.
The warning automatically includes the name of the containing
function, and it is only displayed if `warning-minimum-log-level'
is `:debug' at expansion time (otherwise the macro expands to nil
and is eliminated by the byte-compiler).  When debugging, the
form also returns nil so, e.g. it may be used in a conditional in
place of nil.

Each of ARGS may be a string, which is displayed as-is, or a
symbol, the value of which is displayed prefixed by its name, or
a Lisp form, which is displayed prefixed by its first symbol.

Before the actual ARGS arguments, you can write keyword
arguments, i.e. alternating keywords and values.  The following
keywords are supported:

  :buffer BUFFER   Name of buffer to pass to `display-warning'.
  :level  LEVEL    Level passed to `display-warning', which see.
                   Default is :debug."

(require 'lib-common)
#+END_SRC

**** Configuration of important files/directories

Must be set before loading Org-Mode or any of its sub-features are used.

Most notes will be stored in `ceamx-notes-dir'.

The value of `org-directory' will be used as a default destination for new
notes, especially as they relate to tasks and agendas.  For that reason, use
the `ceamx-agenda-dir'.

FIXME: Because these directories are managed by Syncthing, creating them
automatically is not a great idea if they do not already exist.  A better
workaround to the issue of Org-Mode failing to load might be setting the
default target to a subdirectory of `user-emacs-directory'.

Why?  Because you do not want to end up with two Syncthing entries with the
same intended target path but with different IDs.  If Syncthing is not set up
yet, then any directory created via the Emacs configuration will probably
result in a conflict when Syncthing tries to take control of these paths.

*** Tasks

**** TODO Meow overwrites repeat-mode?

**** CANCELLED Fix no-cycle when press TAB at headline EOL
CLOSED: [2024-03-18 Mon 23:53]

- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2024-03-18 Mon 23:53] \\
  Works as intended.
I think this happens because when there is folded content EOL is considered
part of that folded content, so the TAB press is technically not on the
headline.


**** TODO Repeat-mode for navigating tree



- Note taken on [2024-03-18 Mon 23:52] \\
  I saw some post on Reddit about an integration with Meow for this purpose the
  other day... not sure if I saved it though.

**** TODO [#B] Bind =org-insert-subheading=

**** DONE Figure out why completion is broken
CLOSED: [2024-03-18 Mon 23:51]

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-03-18 Mon 23:51]
Answer: I was expecting Corfu's Elisp completion in this Org file buffer, but
mode-specific completion will only work once opening the src block in an
indirect buffer with =org-edit-src-code=.

However, it would still be nice if I could get symbol completion inside of
inline code markup.


**** CANCELLED Figure out why Elisp source blocks are broken
CLOSED: [2024-03-18 Mon 23:52]

- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2024-03-18 Mon 23:52] \\
  Not "broken", just misunderstood.
