#+TITLE: ceamx -- an emacs configuration

** =magit-delta=

As of <2023-06-20 Tue>, removed primarily because of the massive hit to performance. 
See <[[https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta/issues/9][https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta/issues/9]]> for details.

Also it requires disabling =line-numbers= in configuration, which isn't a big issue but was the initial reason I uninstalled.
See <[[https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta/issues/13][https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta/issues/13]]0> for details.
