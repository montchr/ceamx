;;  Modeline configuration

;;; Code:

(require 'lib-common)

(use-feature! emacs
  :config
  (setopt line-number-mode t)
  (setopt column-number-mode t))

(use-feature! time
  :config
  (setopt display-time-24hr-format t))

(use-package minions
  :commands (minions-mode)
  :config
  (minions-mode 1))

;;;; Show current command and its binding with ~keycast~

;; <https://github.com/tarsius/keycast>

;; Supports display in the mode-line, header-line, tab-bar, and as messages in a
;; dedicated frame.

;; NOTE: Incompatible with kitchen-sink modeline packages like `doom-modeline'
;; and `telephone-line'.

(use-package keycast
