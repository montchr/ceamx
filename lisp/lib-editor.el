(defun ceamx/continue-comment ()
  "Continue current comment, preserving trailing whitespace.
This differs from `default-indent-new-line' in the following way:

If you have a comment like \";; Some text\" with point at the end
of the line, then running `default-indent-new-line' will get you
a new line with \";; \", but running it again will get you a line
with only \";;\" (no trailing whitespace). This is annoying for
inserting a new paragraph in a comment. With this command, the
two inserted lines are the same."
  (interactive)
  ;; `default-indent-new-line' uses `delete-horizontal-space'
  ;; because in auto-filling we want to avoid the space character at
  ;; the end of the line from being put at the beginning of the next
  ;; line. But when continuing a comment it's not desired.
