;;; Code:

;;; Universal, non-nuclear escape

;; `keyboard-quit' is too much of a nuclear option. I wanted an ESC/C-g to
;; do-what-I-mean. It serves four purposes (in order):
;;
;; 1. Quit active states; e.g. highlights, searches, snippets, iedit,
;;    multiple-cursors, recording macros, etc.
;; 2. Close popup windows remotely (if it is allowed to)
;; 3. Refresh buffer indicators, like git-gutter and flycheck
;; 4. Or fall back to `keyboard-quit'
;;
;; And it should do these things incrementally, rather than all at once. And it
;; shouldn't interfere with recording macros or the minibuffer. This may require
;; you press ESC/C-g two or three times on some occasions to reach
;; `keyboard-quit', but this is much more intuitive.

(defvar cmx-escape-hook nil
  "A hook run when C-g is pressed (or ESC in normal mode, for evil users).

More specifically, when `cmx/escape' is pressed. If any hook returns non-nil,
all hooks after it are ignored.")

(defun cmx/escape (&optional interactive)
  "Run `cmx-escape-hook'."
  (interactive (list 'interactive))
  (let ((inhibit-quit t))
    (cond ((minibuffer-window-active-p (minibuffer-window))
           ;; quit the minibuffer if open.
           (when interactive
             (setq this-command 'abort-recursive-edit))
           (abort-recursive-edit))
          ;; Run all escape hooks. If any returns non-nil, then stop there.
          ((run-hook-with-args-until-success 'cmx-escape-hook))
          ;; don't abort macros
          ((or defining-kbd-macro executing-kbd-macro) nil)

          ((unwind-protect (keyboard-quit)
             (when interactive
               (setq this-command 'keyboard-quit)))))))
