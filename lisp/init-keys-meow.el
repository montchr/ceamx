;; Load meow after Which-Key to circumvent Meow-Keypad UI issues

;; Meow's leader functionality has a custom keybinding visualization helper that
;; looks almost exactly like =which-key= except that it is very buggy. It does try
;; to smooth over some of the guts of Meow, as =which-key= is cluttered with
;; keybinding entries for =meow-digit-argument=. But even Meow's maintainers do not
;; recommend using the custom keypad helper UI.

;; Unfortunately, AFAIK there is no way to disable the UI feature explicitly
;; without disabling the Keypad entirely. The only way to prevent this feature from
;; causing workflow issues is by installing =which-key= and letting Meow defer to
;; =which-key= for this kind of interface.

;; And so, we load Meow after Which-Key:


;; [[file:../config.org::*Load meow after Which-Key to circumvent Meow-Keypad UI issues][Load meow after Which-Key to circumvent Meow-Keypad UI issues:1]]
(with-eval-after-load 'which-key

;; And allow Elpaca to finish processing its queues, since everything afterwards depends on Meow.
