;; Prevent package.el from enabling all packages before init.
;;
;; When nil and using the builtin package manager, `package-initialize' must be
;; invoked in the init process prior to `require'ing any packages installed with
;; `package-install'.
;;
;; When non-nil, there is no need to invoke `package-initialize'.

;; From Eli Zaretskii:

;; > My advice is to spend some time measuring the effect of increased GC threshold
;; > on operations that you care about and that take a long enough time to annoy,
;; > and use the lowest threshold value which produces a tangible improvement.
;; > Start with the default value, then enlarge it by a factor of 2 until you see
;; > only insignificant speedups. I would not expect the value you arrive at to be
;; > as high as 100 MiB.
