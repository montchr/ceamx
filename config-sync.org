;;;; Use latest versions of some Emacs builtins to satisfy bleeding-edge packages

;; Installing the latest development versions of `eglot' and `magit' (for
;; example) comes with the significant caveat that their dependencies often
;; track the latest versions of builtin Emacs libraries. Those can be installed
;; via GNU ELPA.
;;
;; Since core libraries like `seq' are often dependencies of many other packages
;; or otherwise loaded immediately (like `eldoc'), installation and activation
;; of the newer versions needs to happen upfront to avoid version conflicts and
;; mismatches. For example, we do not want some package loaded earlier in init
;; to think it is using the builtin version of `seq', while a package loaded
;; later in init uses a differnt version. I am not sure how realistic such a
;; scenario might be, or whether it would truly pose a problem, but the point is
;; that we should aim for consistency.
;;
;; Oftentimes, these builtins must be unloaded before loading the newer version.
;; This applies especially to core libraries like `seq' or the
;; enabled-by-default `global-eldoc-mode' provided by `eldoc', but not
;; `jsonrpc', since its functionality is specific to more niche features like
;; inter-process communication in the case of `eglot'.

;;;;; Install the latest version of `seq' builtin library, carefully

;; `magit' requires a more recent version of `seq' than the version included in
;; Emacs 29.

;; Requires special care because unloading it can make other libraries freak out.

;;; Commentary:

;; <karthink> has a helpful summary of `display-buffer' action functions and
;; alist entries in their Emacs configuration, which I am also including here
;; for my own reference. Note that this list is not necessarily complete.

;;;; display-buffer-action-functions are:
;;  `display-buffer-same-window' -- Use the selected window.
;;  `display-buffer-reuse-window' -- Use a window already showing the buffer.
;;  `display-buffer-reuse-mode-window' -- Use a window with the same major-mode.
;;  `display-buffer-in-previous-window' -- Use a window that did show the buffer before.
;;  `display-buffer-use-some-window' -- Use some existing window.
;;  `display-buffer-pop-up-window' -- Pop up a new window.
;;  `display-buffer-below-selected' -- Use or pop up a window below the selected one.
;;  `display-buffer-at-bottom' -- Use or pop up a window at the bottom of the selected frame.
;;  `display-buffer-pop-up-frame' -- Show the buffer on a new frame.
;;  `display-buffer-in-child-frame' -- Show the buffer in a child frame.
;;  `display-buffer-no-window' -- Do not display the buffer and have `display-buffer' return nil immediately.

;;;; Action alist entries are:
;;  `inhibit-same-window' -- A non-nil value prevents the same
;;     window from being used for display.
;;  `inhibit-switch-frame' -- A non-nil value prevents any frame
;;     used for showing the buffer from being raised or selected.
;;  `reusable-frames' -- The value specifies the set of frames to
;;     search for a window that already displays the buffer.
;;     Possible values are nil (the selected frame), t (any live
;;     frame), visible (any visible frame), 0 (any visible or
;;     iconified frame) or an existing live frame.
;;  `pop-up-frame-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of
;;     frame parameters to give a new frame, if one is created.
;;  `window-height' -- The value specifies the desired height of the
;;     window chosen and is either an integer (the total height of
;;     the window), a floating point number (the fraction of its
;;     total height with respect to the total height of the frame's
;;     root window) or a function to be called with one argument -
;;     the chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the
;;     height of the window; its return value is ignored.  Suitable
;;     functions are `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer' and
;;     `fit-window-to-buffer'.
;;  `window-width' -- The value specifies the desired width of the
;;     window chosen and is either an integer (the total width of
;;     the window), a floating point number (the fraction of its
;;     total width with respect to the width of the frame's root
;;     window) or a function to be called with one argument - the
;;     chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the width
;;     of the window; its return value is ignored.
;;  `preserve-size' -- The value should be either (t . nil) to
;;     preserve the width of the chosen window, (nil . t) to
;;     preserve its height or (t . t) to preserve its height and
;;     width in future changes of the window configuration.
;;  `window-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of window
;;     parameters to give the chosen window.
;;  `allow-no-window' -- A non-nil value means that `display-buffer'
;;     may not display the buffer and return nil immediately.

;;; Commentary:

;; This configuration file is intended to be loaded after every keybinding is in
;; place, in an effort to help these packages reference the final state of all
;; keybindings.

;; For example, `which-key' does not seem to like the way that `meow' handles
;; keybindings -- see the documentation for
;; `meow-keypad-describe-keymap-function' -- displaying only
;; `which-key-prefix-prefix'. `general.el' behaves similarly, from what I can
;; recall. I suspect this has something to do with key translations, a subject
;; with which I am currently unfamiliar.

;; 2024-01-13 UPDATE: My previous note about `which-key' and `meow' interaction
;; makes me wonder if in fact the behavior I was describing was actually Meow's
;; broken `which-key'-like popups. Still, I have seen the described behavior
;; from both packages.

;; I would much rather have some slightly-more-manual method of compiling these
;; "cheatsheets" for specific maps in a hydra-like UI. But I don't want to
;; entirely sacrifice the usage of builtin keymap functionality for the
;; abstractions of hydra. Perhaps there's a way to shadow the keymaps similarly
;; to what `which-key' does, maybe? (i'm guessing) but with more control?

  ;;
  ;; 1. (setopt completion-styles '(orderless))
  ;; This configuration results in a very coherent completion experience,

  ;;
  ;; 2. (setopt completion-styles '(substring orderless))
  ;; By trying substring before orderless, TAB expansion is possible.
  ;; The downside is that you can observe the switch from substring to orderless
  ;; during completion, less coherent.
  ;;
  ;; 3. (setopt completion-styles '(orderless basic))
  ;; Certain dynamic completion tables (completion-table-dynamic)
  ;; do not work properly with orderless. One can add basic as a fallback.
  ;; Basic will only be used when orderless fails, which happens only for
  ;; these special tables.
  ;;
  ;; 4. (setopt completion-styles '(substring orderless basic))
  ;; Combine substring, orderless and basic.
  ;;
  (setopt completion-styles '(orderless basic))

;;; Commentary:

;;;; Requirements:

;; Emacs 29+ built with tree-sitter support.
;; If using Nix, this is handled by default, done.
;;
;; Linux: `pkgs.emacs29' or `emacs-overlay.packages.emacs-unstable-pgtk'
;; Darwin: `pkgs.emacs29-macport'

;; Add these to `programs.emacs.extraPackages':
;;
;;  - `epkgs.treesit-auto'
;;  - `epkgs.treesit-grammars.with-all-grammars'

;;;; Mode Association:

;; NOTE: This feature is intended to be loaded *after* all other language
;;       packages have been installed so that `treesit-auto' it can override `auto-mode-alist'.

;;  By default, Emacs plays it safe with tree-sitter language support so as not
;;  to override legacy mode file extension associations. This makes sense as a
;;  default, but it's a pain to have to override `auto-mode-alist' for every
;;  language individually.
;;
;;  `treesit-auto' is pretty smart about how it handles these behaviors; its
;;  readme provides more in-depth details.

;;  In short, `global-treesit-auto-mode' will:
;;
;;  - Automatically switch to <name>-ts-mode when the grammar for <name> is installed
;;  - Stick with <name>-mode if the grammar isn’t installed
;;  - Automatically install a grammar before opening a compatible file
;;  - Modify auto-mode-alist for tree-sitter modes

;;  See also <https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d/blob/master/lisp/init-treesitter.el>
;;  for a more manual approach.

Includes some old but maybe still useful functions to clean up websites like
Wikipedia, Reddit, and GitHub.

However, I know that GitHub has become completely unusable without JavaScript in
the past year or so, so it is likely impossible to access it directly in Emacs
without using its API.

In a general sense, a method for quickly browsing other people's projects on
GitHub within a minimal format is something I am still seeking out.
